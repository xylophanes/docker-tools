Centos 7 Docker CE container image with simple (bash based) management tools.

The Centos container supports a full development environment:

* gcc tool chain
* gdb
* bash,sh,ksh,tcsh etc
* sshd access (secure shell)
* vnc access (remote desktop)
* PUPS/P3 (Organic computing environment)

In addition there are a number of shell scripts to manage this image:

1. bootsetup: creates a script to deploy a customisable Centos container based on
   the generic Centos 7 image.

2. dockerboot.in: template script for customisable container boot script (used by
   bootsetup).

3. dockerhalt.in: template script for cusomisable container halt script (used by
   bootsetup).

4. dockerflatten: utilility to image (modified) container and place it in specified
   image repository.

5. generic.dockerboot: example boot script

6. generic.dockerhalt: example halt script

To create a repository containing intial image (assuming you have Docker CE installed on
your Linux box) type:

docker pull coytius/centos-ssh-dev (should create image centos-ssh-dev:generic.27.Sept.2019
locally)

Then:

generic.dockerboot (to start container)

ssh -p 2025 generic@localhost (to access container) [password is: 12qw34er]

generic.dockerhalt [kill] to stop container - the optional kill parameter removes the
container. If you have made changes in the container, you may want to commit them. To
do this:

generic.dockerhalt (halt container but don't delete it)
dockerflatten      (follow interactive instructions)
generic.dockerhalt kill (remove container once it has been committed to repository
